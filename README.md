# 1D GLM-MHD Riemann Solver

This repository contains a minimal implementation of the 1D Riemann problem described in "Hyperbolic Divergence Cleaning for the MHD Equations". The code solves the problem using an HLL flux with GLM divergence cleaning. Only the features required for the 1D test case are kept.

## Running

Execute `run.sh` to compile the solver and generate analysis plots.
